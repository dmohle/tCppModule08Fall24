Final Programming Assignment: Enhancing Search Algorithms in C++
Objective: Enhance and expand the given C++ program that implements both linear and binary search algorithms. The goal is to improve the program's functionality, understand algorithm efficiency, and apply basic modifications and analysis techniques.

Starter Code: Provide the students with the initial C++ code containing the linear and binary search algorithms. (Note: The provided example will need to be translated into C++ from the Java version given in the previous example.)

Tasks:

Add Iteration Count to Linear Search:

Description: Modify the linear search function to count and print the number of iterations it takes to either find the target or conclude that the target is not in the array.
Purpose: This task helps students understand the concept of algorithm efficiency and gives them practice in modifying existing code.
Implement a Recursive Version of Binary Search:

Description: Write a recursive version of the binary search algorithm in C++. Use the existing binary search as a reference, but convert the iterative process into a recursive method.
Purpose: Introduces students to recursive programming, an important concept in computer science, while also demonstrating another way to implement binary search in C++.
Error Handling:

Description: Add error handling to the program to manage user inputs that could cause errors (e.g., non-integer inputs, empty array inputs).
Purpose: Teaches students about robust program design and prepares them to handle unexpected or incorrect input gracefully in their programs.
Performance Comparison:

Description: Implement functionality to time how long each search method takes to execute and report these times to the user. Consider searching for elements at different positions (e.g., first, middle, last) to show how the performance may vary.
Purpose: Provides practical insight into the performance differences between linear and binary search, reinforcing the theoretical Big O notation concepts.
Expected Outcomes: By the end of this assignment, students should be able to:

Modify and enhance existing code with additional functionality.
Understand and implement basic error handling in C++.
Explain the differences in complexity and efficiency between linear and binary search.
Use recursive methods to solve problems in C++.
Submission Guidelines: Students should submit a single C++ source file containing their modified code to the Module 08 GitHub Classroom remote repo. Remember to comment your code adequately and explain your logic and any changes you made to the starter code.

Assessment Criteria:

Correctness of the implemented features.
Robustness in handling edge cases and incorrect inputs.
Clarity and quality of the code comments.
Efficiency of the recursive binary search implementation.
This assignment not only enhances coding skills but also deepens students' understanding of search algorithms and their complexities, providing a practical foundation in computer science principles across different programming languages.
